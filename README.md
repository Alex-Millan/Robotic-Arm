# Robotic-Arm
Control a robotic arm with a keyboard using a raspberry pi 3. Program will be done on C++. 

Self-assigned reading: Exploring Raspberry Pi: Interfacing to the real world with embedded Linux by Derek Molloy 
                       Professional C++  by Marc Gregoire 

Additional projects will later be build on top of this project. 

Files include: README.md
               

Task to complete: Read over Raspberry Pi 3 MAX/MIN Specs to ensure no pins will be damaged.
                  Turn on an LED with an GPIO pin by a c++ program written by me.
                  Read over how to get user input on c++ with the raspberry pi.
                  Create a c++ echo program with the user input.
                  Turn on and off an LED with user input
                  Turn on and off 8 pins with 8 different LEDs
                  Read the specs of the Robotic arms motors to determine voltage needed to drive motors.
                  Design Raspberry pi and Robotic arm Circuit with voltage analysis at each node.
                  Before connecting raspberry pi pins, measure output of the motors with a voltmeter. 
                  If voltage and current are well within specs, test the circuit.
