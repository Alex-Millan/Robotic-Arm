# Robotic-Arm
Control a robotic arm with a keyboard using a raspberry pi 3. Program will be done on C++. 

Self-assigned reading: Exploring Raspberry Pi: Interfacing to the real world with embedded Linux by Derek Molloy 
                       Professional C++  by Marc Gregoire 

Additional projects will later be build on top of this project. 

Files include: README.md
               
x = done
Task to complete: x Read over Raspberry Pi 3 MAX/MIN Specs to ensure no pins will be damaged.
                  x Turn on an LED with an GPIO pin by a c++ program written by me.
                  x Read over how to get user input on c++ with the raspberry pi.
                  x Create a c++ echo program with the user input.
                  x Turn on and off an LED with user input
                  x Turn on and off 8 pins with 8 different LEDs
                  x Read the specs of the Robotic arms motors to determine voltage needed to drive motors.
                  ~ Design Raspberry pi and Robotic arm Circuit with voltage analysis at each node.
                  	~ No longer needed due to using L239D motor drive.
		  x Before connecting raspberry pi pins, measure output of the motors with a voltmeter. 
                  x If voltage and current are well within specs, test the circuit.
